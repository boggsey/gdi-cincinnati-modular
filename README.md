GDI Cincinnati Modular Curriculum
================================
---------------------

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to store modular blocks of curriculum that can easily be re-purposed in Girl Develop It classes and workshops. 

## Best practice
Best practices are currently being determined. Ideally, we would create modular blocks of curriculum that do not overlap or interfere with other modules. If a module requires another module for a more complete understanding, that module should be identified in some capacity. All modules should be written in markdown when possible. 

## Current topics covered:
* None

## TODO
* Define modules accurately
* Develop a better process to serve static modules (assemble?)
* Which modules are a priority?
* Does this make sense?
* Identify what is complete and what is in progress
